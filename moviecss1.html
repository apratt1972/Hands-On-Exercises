<h1>Despicable Me</h1>
    
    <p>Despicable Me is about this evil villian Gru and all of his sidekicks called Minions. The minions are these little yellow guys that run around speaking Miniones and they wear denim overalls. Gru and his minions live in this creepy scary looking old house full of traps and weapons. The minions try their best to assist Gru, but just wind up failing in a goofy way. Somehow during Gru's villian attempts, three little girls show up on his doorstep that he winds up adopting. The girls end up really liking Gru and his minions. It is an overall goofy moive. </p>
